# About:
This benchmark was created for comparing two XML databases (BaseX and eXist) for the project [ffmap](http://code.google.com/p/ffmap/ "ffmap on Code Google"). It uses cProfile and time packages to provide rough speed comparison of these two databases.

## Usage:
For now, you can just run:
    ./basexbench.py
or
    ./existbench.py
